This repository is a complete authentication boilerplate for NextJS applications.

## What is used ?

- NextJS
- NextAuth
- ReactJS
- SendGrid
- Material-UI
- MongoDB
- Nodemailer
- Uuid

## Who is this repository for ?

Authentication has always been problematic and hard to implement for web developers. Here, I used NextAuth based authentication for NextJS applications. I used Passwordless Sign In and Credentials Sign In functionality of NextAuth and added password reset also. 

## Deployment

I deployed it on Vercel. Here is the link so you can test it out.
